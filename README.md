# Code Minimalism Movement

Emphasize the importance of writing less code. 

## Manifesto

1. Write the minimum code needed to accomplish the task.
   1. Read your code again in order to remove the unencessary code.

2. Write more code than needed only if at least 2 of the following conditions
are satisified:
  a. MWrite more code allow contributors to understand better the code itself.
  b. Write more code made the implementation more efficent. 
  c. Write more code allow to reuse it at least in 3 different places. 
  d. Adding code allow to test it.

## Why

Having less code have a lot of benefits. We can list a non comprehensive list
of the most important benefits:

1. Less code is more maintainable.
2. Less code has less bugs.
3. Less code is easier to modify and to extend.
4. Less code is, usually, more efficent.
5. Less code require, usually, less time to write it.
6. Less code is easier to test.
7. Less code is easier to read.
8. Less code is easier to rewrite somewhere else or in other language.
9. Less code is easier to review and increase collaboration.
